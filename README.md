# Applications for developing a birds eye perspective

This repository has the two main programs
1. gui based
2. plain algorithm 

To run you require the following:
1. OpenCV
2. Tkinter (for the gui, ignore if you are just intrested in the algorithm)
3.matplotlib
4. Pillow
5. numpy

the names are indicated by the file name. 

I have put in two test images and for easier visualization i have also marked the points on the road so you can verify them once you generate the birds eye view. The terminal will have the rough distance associated with the image. Please note that the distances might not be accurate since depth perception through single images is quite difficult.
